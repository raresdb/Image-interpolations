Interpolation functions that can be used on RGB or Grayscale images for resizing or rotation.
The images are represented as matrices of pixels(each pixel having 1 value for grayscale and 3
for RGB).

The types of interpolations used:
nearest-neighbour(nn): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest-neighbor_interpolation
bilinear: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation
bicubic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicubic_interpolation
